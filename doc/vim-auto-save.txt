Description
                                                       *auto-save-description*

AutoSave - automatically save changes to disk without having to use `:w` (or any binding to it) every time a buffer has been modified or based on your preferred events.

Inspired by the same feature in RubyMine text editor.

By default AutoSave will save every time something has been changed in normal mode and when the user leaves insert mode. This configuration is a mix between "save as often as possible" and "try to avoid breaking other plugins that depend on filewrite-events". 

==============================================================================
Installation
                                                      *auto-save-installation*

Use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or download [packaged version]
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4521) from vim.org.

==============================================================================
Options
                                                           *auto-save-options*

AutoSave is disabled by default, run `:AutoSaveToggle` to enable/disable it.
If you want plugin to be always enabled it can be done with `g:auto_save` option:
>
  " .vimrc
  let g:auto_save = 1  " enable AutoSave on Vim startup
<

                                                            *auto-save-silent*
AutoSave will display on the status line on each auto-save by default.
>
  (AutoSaved at 08:40:55)
<

You can silence the display with the `g:auto_save_silent` option:
>
  " .vimrc
  let g:auto_save_silent = 1  " do not display the auto-save notification
<

                                                     *auto-save-postsave-hook*
If you need an autosave hook (such as generating tags post-save) then use `g:auto_save_postsave_hook` option:
>
  " .vimrc
  let g:auto_save_postsave_hook = 'TagsGenerate'  " this will run :TagsGenerate after each save
<

                                                            *auto-save-events*
The events on which AutoSave will perform a save can be adjusted using the `g:auto_save_events` option.
Using `InsertLeave` and `TextChanged` only, the default, will save on every change in normal mode and every time you leave insert mode.

>
  let g:auto_save_events = ["InsertLeave", "TextChanged"]
<

Using `CursorHold` will additionally save every amount of milliseconds as defined in the `updatetime` option in normal mode.
`CursorHoldI` will do the same thing in insert mode. `CompleteDone` will also trigger a save after every completion event. See the autocommands overview for a complete listing (`:h autocommand-events`).

Be advised to be careful with the `updatetime` option since it has shown to cause problems when set too small. 200 seems already to be too small to work with certain other plugins. Use 1000 for a more conservative setting.

>
  ".vimrc
  let updatetime=200
  let g:auto_save_events = [ "CursorHold", "CursorHoldI", "CompleteDone", "InsertLeave" ]
<

                                                        *auto-save-keep-marks*
The `g:auto_save_keep_marks` option preserves marks that are used to remember start
and end position of the last changed or yanked text (`:h '[`).
This also fixes the behavior for common mappings that depend on these marks,
like the [selecting your pasted text](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Selecting_your_pasted_text) mapping.
This options default value is `1`.
Without it, the mapping will select the whole buffer, because a write operation sets
the `'[` and `']` marks respectively to the start and end of the buffer. If you
want vims default behavior, set the options value to 0:

>
  let g:auto_save_keep_marks = 0 " Don't keep the '[ and '] marks. It will break
                                 " the selecting your pasted text mapping:
                                 " http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Selecting_your_pasted_text
<
